1. In responsive mode when I open menu, and click on any one option menu should hide automatically it stays there. So for new menu-item user should click on menu icon again.
2. You forgot to add Award section it it. Kindly add award section and make sure you make space for image, so in future i can add the image of award certificate to it. For now have the coding commented. Make it also responsive and animated.
3. Make professional section in such a way that it's easy to read for end users also keep the same design color and animations may be you can reduce font size. It's still not responsive when I see it in mobile. Please make the whole section as responsive. Text is not fitting properly.
